const TEMPO: &str = "\
TEMPO
=====
Tempo is the number of blocks between weight evaluation rounds on a subnet.

- Each subnet has its own tempo (e.g., 360 blocks ≈ 72 minutes at 12s/block).
- At each tempo boundary, Yuma consensus runs: weights are evaluated, ranks
  computed, and emissions distributed.
- Miners/validators are scored based on weights set during the tempo.
- Check a subnet's tempo: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>`
- Blocks until next tempo = tempo - (current_block % tempo)

Practical impact:
- Weight changes only take effect at the next tempo boundary.
- If you set weights right after a tempo, you wait the full cycle.
- Plan your weight updates to land before the next tempo.";

const COMMIT_REVEAL: &str = "\
COMMIT-REVEAL
=============
A two-phase weight submission scheme that prevents weight copying.

Phase 1 — COMMIT: Hash your weights + a secret salt, submit the hash on-chain.
Phase 2 — REVEAL: After a waiting period, reveal the actual weights + salt.

Why it exists:
- Without commit-reveal, validators can observe others' weight transactions in
  the mempool and copy them before the tempo evaluates. This is a form of
  'weight mimicry' that undermines honest scoring.
- Commit-reveal ensures weights stay secret until the reveal window.

How to use it:
  # Commit (saves the salt — keep it!)
  agcli weights commit --netuid 97 \"0:100,1:200\" --salt mysecret

  # Wait for the reveal window (check commit_reveal_weights_interval in hyperparams)

  # Reveal (must use same weights + salt)
  agcli weights reveal --netuid 97 \"0:100,1:200\" mysecret

Check if a subnet uses commit-reveal:
  agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>  →  commit_reveal_weights = true/false

The commit_reveal_weights_interval hyperparam controls how many tempos
you must wait before revealing.";

const YUMA: &str = "\
YUMA CONSENSUS
==============
Yuma consensus is Bittensor's incentive mechanism. It determines how emissions
are distributed based on validator weight-setting agreements.

How it works:
1. Validators set weights on miners based on perceived performance.
2. At each tempo, the chain aggregates all validator weights.
3. Consensus is reached: miners that multiple validators agree on get higher
   incentive scores. The consensus mechanism rewards agreement.
4. Emissions split: miners get incentive-based share, validators get
   dividends proportional to how well their weights matched consensus.

Key metrics (visible in metagraph):
- Trust:      How much a miner's performance is trusted by validators
- Consensus:  Degree of agreement on a miner's value
- Incentive:  Final score → determines miner's emission share
- Dividends:  Validator's emission share for accurate scoring
- VTrust:     Validator trust — how well a validator's weights match consensus

Why it matters:
- Validators who set accurate weights earn more dividends.
- Miners who deliver real value to multiple validators earn more incentive.
- Gaming the system (weight copying, collusion) is penalized by consensus.

View metagraph: `agcli subnet metagraph <netuid>`";

const RATE_LIMITS: &str = "\
RATE LIMITS
===========
The chain enforces rate limits on weight-setting to prevent spam and ensure stability.

weights_rate_limit: Number of blocks you must wait between set_weights calls.
  - Typical: 100 blocks (≈20 minutes at 12s/block)
  - If you try to set weights before the limit expires, the extrinsic fails.

tx_rate_limit: Global transaction rate limit per account.

How to check:
  agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>  →  weights_rate_limit

Practical tips:
- Before calling set_weights, check when you last set weights.
- The error 'SettingWeightsTooFast' or 'TxRateLimitExceeded' means you need to wait.
- Rate limits apply per-hotkey per-subnet, not globally.
- Plan weight updates to be infrequent but well-timed (just before tempo).";

const STAKE_WEIGHT: &str = "\
STAKE-WEIGHT MINIMUM (1000τ)
=============================
To set weights on a subnet, your validator needs a minimum amount of effective
stake-weight. The typical threshold is 1000 TAO equivalent.

Why it exists:
- Prevents low-stake accounts from manipulating subnet scoring.
- Ensures validators have meaningful economic commitment.

What counts toward stake-weight:
- Direct stake from your coldkey to your hotkey on the subnet.
- Delegated (nominated) stake from other coldkeys.
- Childkey delegations from parent hotkeys.

If you're below the threshold:
  1. Ask others to stake/delegate to your validator hotkey.
  2. Move more of your own TAO to stake on that subnet.
  3. Use commit-reveal instead of direct set_weights (some subnets allow
     commit-reveal at lower thresholds).

Check your stake: `agcli stake list`
Check subnet requirements: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>`";

const AMM: &str = "\
AMM (DYNAMIC TAO / ALPHA POOLS)
================================
Each subnet has a constant-product AMM (Automated Market Maker) pool that
creates a market between TAO and the subnet's alpha token.

Pool mechanics:
- Two-sided pool: TAO side (tao_in) and Alpha side (alpha_in).
- Price = tao_in / alpha_in (constant-product formula: x * y = k).
- When you stake TAO on a subnet, it swaps through the AMM → you get alpha.
- When you unstake, alpha swaps back → you get TAO.

Slippage:
- Small pools = high slippage. A 10τ stake on a pool with 100τ depth causes
  ~10% slippage (you get fewer alpha per TAO than the listed price).
- Check slippage before staking: `agcli view swap-sim --netuid N --tao 10`

Key metrics:
- price: Current τ/α exchange rate
- tao_in: TAO side of the pool (liquidity depth)
- alpha_in: Alpha side of the pool
- moving_price: Exponential moving average of price (32 fractional bits)

Tips for operators:
- Don't stake/unstake large amounts on shallow pools — use limit orders.
- Watch the pool depth: `agcli subnet show <netuid>` shows tao_in.
- The AMM means your alpha is always liquid — you can unstake anytime.";

const BOOTSTRAP: &str = "\
BOOTSTRAP GUIDE — New Subnet Owners
====================================
Getting a new subnet operational step-by-step:

1. REGISTER THE SUBNET
   agcli subnet register
   (Costs the current subnet registration price — check with `agcli view network`)

2. GET STAKE ON YOUR VALIDATOR
   Your hotkey needs enough stake to set weights (typically 1000τ stake-weight).
   agcli stake add <amount> --netuid <your_netuid>
   Or ask delegators/nominators to stake to your hotkey.

3. SET INITIAL WEIGHTS
   agcli weights set --netuid <your_netuid> \"0:100\"
   (Set weights on at least one UID — usually yourself for bootstrapping)

4. CONFIGURE HYPERPARAMS (as subnet owner)
   The owner can adjust subnet parameters through governance proposals or
   directly if the chain allows direct hyperparam setting.

5. REGISTER MINERS
   Miners register via burn or POW:
   agcli subnet register-neuron <netuid>
   agcli subnet pow <netuid>

6. ONBOARD VALIDATORS
   Other validators register and start setting weights.
   Your subnet becomes healthy when multiple validators independently score miners.

7. MONITOR
   agcli subnet metagraph <netuid>           — see all UIDs and scores
   agcli view subnet-analytics <netuid>      — emission and performance stats

Common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to set weights initially (no emissions flow if no weights set)
- Not having enough stake to pass the stake-weight minimum
- Setting tempo too low (frequent evals) or too high (slow feedback)";

const ALPHA: &str = "\
ALPHA TOKENS
============
Each subnet issues its own alpha token. Alpha represents your share of the
subnet's staking pool and emission flow.

When you stake TAO on a subnet:
- Your TAO enters the AMM pool.
- You receive alpha tokens in return (at the current exchange rate).
- Your alpha entitles you to a share of the subnet's emissions.

When you unstake:
- Your alpha goes back through the AMM.
- You receive TAO (at the current exchange rate — may differ from when you staked).

Alpha operations:
  agcli stake add 10 --netuid 5         # TAO → alpha (stake)
  agcli stake remove 10 --netuid 5      # alpha → TAO (unstake)
  agcli stake recycle-alpha 10 --netuid 5   # recycle alpha back to TAO
  agcli stake burn-alpha 10 --netuid 5      # permanently burn alpha (reduce supply)

Key insight: alpha is always liquid through the AMM, but slippage matters on
small pools. Use `agcli view swap-sim` to preview swap amounts.";

const EMISSION: &str = "\
EMISSIONS
=========
TAO is emitted every block and distributed across subnets and within each subnet.

Block emission: ~1τ per block (halving schedule applies).

Distribution chain:
1. BLOCK EMISSION → split across all subnets based on root weights.
2. SUBNET EMISSION → split between:
   - alpha_out_emission: goes to alpha holders (stakers)
   - alpha_in_emission: goes into the AMM pool
   - tao_in_emission: goes into the TAO side of the pool
3. WITHIN SUBNET → Yuma consensus distributes to validators (dividends)
   and miners (incentive) based on weights and consensus scores.

Check emission rates:
  agcli view network                    — block emission, total stake
  agcli subnet show <netuid>            — subnet emission per tempo
  agcli view subnet-analytics <netuid>  — detailed emission breakdown
  agcli view staking-analytics          — your personal emission estimates";

const REGISTRATION: &str = "\
REGISTRATION
============
Neurons (miners/validators) must register on a subnet to participate.

Two registration methods:

1. BURN REGISTRATION — Pay TAO to register instantly.
   agcli subnet register-neuron <netuid>
   Cost varies per subnet and adjusts with demand (check `agcli subnet show`).

2. POW REGISTRATION — Solve a proof-of-work puzzle.
   agcli subnet pow <netuid> --threads 8
   Free but competitive — difficulty adjusts to target registration rate.

After registration:
- You get a UID (0 to max_n-1) on the subnet.
- New registrants have an immunity period (immunity_period blocks) where
  they cannot be deregistered.
- If the subnet is full, the lowest-score neuron gets replaced.

Prerequisites:
- A wallet with a coldkey and hotkey: `agcli wallet create`
- TAO balance (for burn registration) or CPU time (for POW)";

const SUBNETS: &str = "\
SUBNETS
=======
Subnets are the core unit of Bittensor. Each subnet defines an incentive game
where validators evaluate miners on a specific task.

Subnet properties:
- netuid: Unique identifier (0 = root network)
- tempo: Evaluation frequency (blocks between consensus rounds)
- max_n: Maximum number of neurons (UIDs) on the subnet
- emission_value: TAO emitted to this subnet per tempo
- Hyperparameters: rho, kappa, immunity_period, weights settings, etc.

Subnet lifecycle:
  1. Owner registers subnet (pays registration price)
  2. Owner configures identity and hyperparameters
  3. Miners and validators register
  4. Validators set weights → emissions flow
  5. Subnet grows or gets dissolved

List subnets: `agcli subnet list`
Subnet details: `agcli subnet show <netuid>`
Hyperparams: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>`";

const VALIDATORS: &str = "\
VALIDATORS
==========
Validators evaluate miners and set weights that determine emission distribution.

Validator responsibilities:
1. Run scoring infrastructure (query miners, evaluate responses).
2. Set weights based on miner performance: `agcli weights set --netuid N \"uid:weight,...\"`
3. Participate in Yuma consensus — accurate weights earn dividends.

Becoming a validator:
1. Register on the subnet: `agcli subnet register-neuron <netuid>`
2. Accumulate enough stake-weight (typically 1000τ).
3. Get validator_permit = true (top N validators by stake get permits).
4. Set weights each tempo.

Key metrics:
- validator_trust (VTrust): How well your weights match consensus.
- dividends: Your share of validator emissions.
- validator_permit: Whether you can set weights (top staked validators).

Common issues:
- 'SettingWeightsTooFast' — wait for rate limit to expire
- 'CommitRevealEnabled' — use commit+reveal workflow instead
- Low VTrust — your weights diverge from other validators";

const MINERS: &str = "\
MINERS
======
Miners perform the actual work on a subnet and earn incentive-based emissions.

Miner responsibilities:
1. Serve an axon endpoint for validators to query.
2. Respond to validator queries with high-quality results.
3. Stay competitive — low-performing miners get deregistered.

Becoming a miner:
1. Register on the subnet: `agcli subnet register-neuron <netuid>`
   Or via POW: `agcli subnet pow <netuid>`
2. Set your axon endpoint: `agcli serve axon --netuid N --ip <ip> --port <port>`
3. Run your miner software (subnet-specific).

Key metrics:
- incentive: Your emission share based on validator weights.
- trust: How much validators trust your responses.
- rank: Your position relative to other miners.
- pruning_score: How likely you are to be replaced (low = at risk).

Protect your position:
- Consistently produce high-quality responses.
- Monitor your scores: `agcli view neuron --netuid N <uid>`
- Watch for adversarial actors (UIDs copying your work).";

const IMMUNITY: &str = "\
IMMUNITY PERIOD
===============
Newly registered neurons get a grace period where they cannot be deregistered.

- Measured in blocks (subnet-specific, typically 4096 blocks ≈ 13.6 hours).
- During immunity, even if your scores are low, you won't be pruned.
- After immunity expires, the lowest-scoring neuron is replaced when a new
  registration arrives and the subnet is full.

Check a subnet's immunity period:
  agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>  →  immunity_period

Why it matters:
- New miners need time to set up their infrastructure and start responding.
- Without immunity, new registrants would be instantly replaced by existing neurons.
- Use the immunity period to get your miner running and serving.";

const DELEGATION: &str = "\
DELEGATION / NOMINATION
=======================
Delegation allows TAO holders to stake their TAO through a validator (delegate),
earning a share of that validator's emissions.

How it works:
1. Validator sets their delegate take (0-11.11%): `agcli delegate increase-take <pct>`
2. Nominator stakes through the validator's hotkey: `agcli stake add <amount> --netuid N --hotkey <validator_hotkey>`
3. Emissions earned by the validator are split: validator keeps their take,
   rest is distributed pro-rata to all nominators.

For nominators:
- Research validators: `agcli delegate list` or `agcli view validators`
- Check take %: lower take = more emissions for you
- Check validator performance: high VTrust = consistently accurate weights
- Diversify across subnets and validators to manage risk

For validators:
- Set a competitive take: `agcli delegate decrease-take <pct>`
- Low take attracts more delegation → more total stake → more influence
- Your reputation matters — consistent performance attracts long-term delegators";

const CHILDKEYS: &str = "\
CHILDKEYS
=========
Childkey delegation allows a parent validator hotkey to share its stake-weight
with child hotkeys on specific subnets.

Use cases:
- Run multiple validator instances with shared stake.
- Delegate your weight to specialized scoring infrastructure.
- Split your validator operations across teams/machines.

Set children: `agcli stake set-children --netuid N --children \"proportion:hotkey,...\"`
Set childkey take: `agcli stake childkey-take <pct> --netuid N`

The proportion determines how much of the parent's stake-weight flows to
each child. Proportions are u64 values — use relative ratios.";

const ROOT_NETWORK: &str = "\
ROOT NETWORK (SN0)
==================
The root network (netuid 0) controls emission distribution across all subnets.

Root validators set weights on subnet netuids to determine how much emission
each subnet receives. Higher root weight → more emission for that subnet.

Joining root:
  agcli root register    — register your hotkey on the root network

Setting root weights:
  agcli root weights \"1:100,5:50,97:200\"   — weight netuids, not UIDs

Root is special:
- Validators on root must have high total stake.
- Root weights directly control the economic incentives for all subnets.
- Changing root weights shifts emission flow across the entire network.";

const PROXY: &str = "\
PROXY ACCOUNTS
==============
Proxy accounts allow one account to act on behalf of another with restricted
permissions, enhancing security for validators and stakers.

Add a proxy:
  agcli proxy add <delegate_ss58> --proxy-type staking

Proxy types:
- any: Full access (dangerous — use sparingly)
- staking: Can stake/unstake but not transfer
- non_transfer: Can do anything except transfer TAO
- governance: Can participate in governance votes
- owner: Subnet owner operations

Why use proxies:
- Keep your coldkey on an air-gapped machine.
- Give your automation/bot limited permissions via a proxy.
- Revoke access without moving funds.

List proxies: `agcli proxy list`
Remove proxy: `agcli proxy remove <delegate_ss58>`";

const COLDKEY_SWAP: &str = "\
COLDKEY SWAP
============
Coldkey swap allows you to migrate your account to a new coldkey. This is a
scheduled operation — it does not execute immediately.

How it works:
1. SCHEDULE: Submit a swap request specifying the new coldkey.
   agcli swap coldkey --new-coldkey <new_ss58>
   The chain records the swap with an execution block (typically days away).

2. WAITING PERIOD: The swap is pending for ColdkeySwapScheduleDuration blocks.
   During this window, the original coldkey still controls the account.

3. EXECUTION: At the execution block, the chain automatically transfers all
   balances, stakes, and permissions from the old coldkey to the new one.

Security implications:
- If someone gains access to your coldkey, they can schedule a swap.
- This is a CRITICAL security event — monitor with `agcli audit`.
- The audit command checks for scheduled swaps and flags them as [!!] high severity.

Detection:
  agcli audit --address <your_coldkey>
  # Shows: 'Coldkey swap scheduled! New coldkey: ... at block ...'

Prevention:
- Use proxy accounts with limited permissions for daily operations.
- Keep your coldkey on an air-gapped or hardware-secured machine.
- Monitor your account regularly with `agcli audit`.
- Set up alerts: `agcli subscribe events --filter all --account <your_coldkey>`

Note: The chain does NOT currently expose a cancel-swap extrinsic. Once scheduled,
a coldkey swap will execute at the scheduled block unless chain governance intervenes.
If you detect an unauthorized swap, contact the Bittensor community immediately.";

const GOVERNANCE: &str = "\
GOVERNANCE
==========
Bittensor uses on-chain governance for protocol upgrades, parameter changes,
and treasury disbursements. Proposals go through a democratic process.

Governance flow:
1. PROPOSAL: A member of the senate (triumvirate) or a council member submits a proposal.
2. VOTING: Token-weighted voting — stake counts as voting power.
3. ENACTMENT: If the proposal passes the vote threshold and any required
   senate approval, it is enacted after a delay period.

Proposal types:
- Runtime upgrades (code changes to the chain)
- Parameter changes (emission schedule, registration costs, hyperparams)
- Treasury proposals (fund allocation from the treasury)

How to participate:
- Vote on proposals using your staked TAO weight.
- Delegate your vote to a trusted validator.
- Monitor active proposals through chain governance tools.

Key parameters:
- Proposals require supermajority or simple majority depending on type.
- Enactment delays give the community time to respond.
- Emergency proposals can bypass some delays with senate approval.";

const SENATE: &str = "\
SENATE (TRIUMVIRATE)
====================
The Senate (also called the Triumvirate) is a small governance body on Bittensor
with elevated permissions for critical chain decisions.

Composition:
- Members are the top validators by total delegated stake.
- Senate size is limited (typically 12 seats).
- Membership is dynamic — it updates as validator stake rankings change.

Powers:
- Can submit governance proposals directly.
- Some proposal types require senate approval to pass.
- Acts as a safety check on governance actions.
- Can fast-track emergency proposals.

How it works:
- Senate membership is automatic for top validators by delegation.
- No explicit application — rack up enough delegated stake and you qualify.
- Losing stake below the threshold means losing your senate seat.

Practical implications:
- Delegating to a validator also grants them governance influence.
- Consider a validator's governance track record when choosing who to delegate to.
- Senate votes are on-chain and transparent.";

const MEV_SHIELD: &str = "\
MEV SHIELD
==========
MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) Shield is a Bittensor-specific pallet that
protects users from transaction ordering manipulation by block producers.

What is MEV?
- Block producers can reorder, insert, or censor transactions within a block.
- On DeFi chains this enables front-running, sandwich attacks, and arbitrage.
- On Bittensor, MEV could affect staking, weight-setting, and AMM trades.

How MevShield works:
- The MevShield pallet adds protection against transaction ordering attacks.
- It uses commit-reveal patterns and timing constraints to make ordering
  manipulation unprofitable or impossible.
- Transactions within a protected window are processed fairly regardless of
  ordering within the block.

Protected operations:
- Stake/unstake operations through the AMM (prevents sandwich attacks).
- Weight commits/reveals (prevents front-running weight updates).
- Swap operations that interact with dynamic TAO pools.

For users:
- MEV protection is automatic — no extra flags needed.
- The protection is built into the chain runtime.
- Large AMM trades still face slippage from the constant-product formula,
  but won't face additional losses from block producer manipulation.
- Use limit orders (`agcli stake add-limit`) for additional price protection.";

const LIMITS: &str = "\
NETWORK & CHAIN LIMITS
======================
Bittensor enforces several limits at the chain level that affect miners,
validators, and stakers.

Weight setting:
- Minimum 1000 stake-weight to set weights directly (use commit-reveal otherwise).
- weights_rate_limit: minimum blocks between weight-set calls per validator per subnet.
- max_weights_limit: maximum number of UIDs that can be included in a single weight vector.
- min_allowed_weights: minimum UIDs required in a weight vector for it to be valid.

Registration:
- max_regs_per_block: cap on burn-registrations processed per block network-wide.
- target_regs_per_interval: target registrations per adjustment_interval, used to
  auto-adjust the burn cost.
- Immunity period: newly registered neurons cannot be deregistered for N blocks.

Staking:
- No minimum stake amount, but very small stakes earn negligible emission.
- Rate limit on stake/unstake operations may apply during high-traffic periods.
- Childkey delegation changes have a cooldown period before taking effect.

Serving:
- serving_rate_limit: minimum blocks between axon metadata updates.
- Axon IP/port must be publicly reachable for miners to receive queries.

General:
- Block time: ~12 seconds.
- Blocks per day: ~7200.
- Max subnets: determined by governance (currently ~64).
- Check current limits: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>`";

const HYPERPARAMS: &str = "\
SUBNET HYPERPARAMETERS
======================
Each subnet has a set of hyperparameters that control its behavior. Subnet owners
can propose changes; some require governance approval.

View them: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>`

Key parameters:
- rho/kappa: Yuma consensus sensitivity parameters. Higher rho → more aggressive
  ranking; kappa controls the consensus threshold.
- tempo: blocks between evaluation rounds (e.g., 360 blocks ≈ 72 min).
- immunity_period: blocks a new neuron is protected from deregistration.
- min_allowed_weights / max_weights_limit: bounds on weight vector size.
- weights_rate_limit: minimum blocks between weight-set calls.
- weights_version: version key validators must match when setting weights.
- min_difficulty / max_difficulty: PoW registration difficulty bounds.
- adjustment_interval / target_regs_per_interval: controls burn auto-adjustment.
- min_burn / max_burn: floor and ceiling for burn registration cost.
- bonds_moving_avg: smoothing factor for bond calculations.
- max_regs_per_block: cap on registrations per block.
- serving_rate_limit: minimum blocks between axon info updates.
- max_validators: maximum validators with permits on this subnet.
- adjustment_alpha: learning rate for difficulty adjustment.
- commit_reveal_weights_enabled: whether two-phase weight submission is active.
- commit_reveal_interval: blocks between commit and reveal phases.
- liquid_alpha_enabled: whether liquid alpha token trading is active.

Changing hyperparams:
- Subnet owners propose changes via `agcli sudo set --netuid <n> --param <name> --value <v>`.
- Some params (like tempo, max_validators) may need root governance approval.
- Changes take effect at the next tempo boundary after being applied.";

const AXON: &str = "\
AXON (SERVING ENDPOINT)
=======================
An axon is the network-facing endpoint that a miner or validator exposes
so other nodes can communicate with it.

What it stores on-chain:
- IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)
- Port number
- Protocol version
- Software version
- Placeholder (reserved field, usually 0)

How it works:
- Miners call `serve_axon` to register their IP:port on a specific subnet.
- Validators query on-chain axon info to discover miner endpoints.
- The serving_rate_limit hyperparameter controls how often axon info can be updated.

Viewing axon info:
- `agcli subnet metagraph <netuid> --uid <uid>` shows a neuron's axon details.
- Entries with IP 0.0.0.0 or port 0 indicate a neuron that hasn't set its axon.

For miners:
- Your axon must be reachable from the public internet.
- Set it early after registration — validators need it to send queries.
- Update if your IP changes (subject to serving_rate_limit).
- Common setup: run your miner behind a reverse proxy or directly with a public IP.

For validators:
- Axon info helps you verify that miners are actually online.
- Neurons with stale or missing axon info may be inactive.
- The `last_update` field in the metagraph shows when the neuron last interacted
  with the chain (not necessarily axon-specific).";

const TAKE: &str = "\
VALIDATOR / DELEGATE TAKE
=========================
Take is the percentage of emissions a validator keeps before distributing dividends
to their delegators (nominators).

How it works:
- A validator earns dividends from Yuma consensus based on weight accuracy.
- Before distributing to delegators, the validator takes a cut (the 'take').
- Remaining dividends are split proportionally among delegators by stake.

Take range:
- Minimum: 0% (validator keeps nothing — all dividends go to delegators)
- Maximum: 11.11% (18% of the u16 max, capped by chain logic)
- Default: typically 11.11% for new validators

Adjusting take:
  agcli delegate decrease-take <pct>    # Lower your take (attracts more delegation)
  agcli delegate increase-take <pct>    # Raise your take (takes effect after delay)

Important: take increases are delayed by the TakeDecreaseDelay hyperparameter
(typically ~7 days) to prevent bait-and-switch tactics. Take decreases
are instant — lowering take to attract stake is immediate.

Strategy:
- Low take attracts more delegators → more total stake → more influence.
- High take keeps more for yourself but discourages delegation.
- Top validators often run 5-9% take as a competitive balance.

Check take: `agcli delegate list` shows take % for all delegates.";

const RECYCLE: &str = "\
RECYCLE & BURN ALPHA
====================
Alpha tokens can be recycled (converted back to TAO) or burned (permanently
destroyed). Both operations reduce the alpha supply on a subnet.

RECYCLE ALPHA:
- Converts your alpha tokens back to TAO through the AMM.
- The alpha goes back into the pool, increasing alpha_in.
- You receive TAO from the pool, decreasing tao_in.
- Subject to AMM slippage on shallow pools.
  agcli stake recycle-alpha <amount> --netuid <N>

BURN ALPHA:
- Permanently destroys alpha tokens, reducing total supply.
- No TAO is returned — the tokens are gone forever.
- Burning increases the value of remaining alpha (deflationary).
- Used by subnet operators to manage token economics.
  agcli stake burn-alpha <amount> --netuid <N>

When to recycle vs burn:
- Recycle: You want your TAO back. Acts like a normal unstake through the AMM.
- Burn: You want to intentionally reduce supply to boost the subnet's alpha value.
  This is a deliberate economic action, not a recovery mechanism.

Slippage warning:
- Both recycle and large unstakes go through the AMM.
- Check the pool depth first: `agcli subnet show <netuid>` (look at tao_in).
- Simulate before acting: `agcli view swap-sim --netuid <N> --alpha <amount>`";

const POW_REGISTRATION: &str = "\
PROOF-OF-WORK REGISTRATION
===========================
PoW registration lets you register a neuron (miner/validator) on a subnet by
solving a computational puzzle instead of paying the burn fee.

How it works:
1. The chain publishes a target difficulty and a block hash as the 'input'.
2. Your node iterates through nonces until it finds one that, when hashed with
   the input, produces a hash below the target difficulty.
3. Submit the solution on-chain: `agcli subnet pow <netuid> --threads 8`
4. If valid and below difficulty, you get a UID on the subnet.

Difficulty adjustment:
- The chain adjusts difficulty based on the target_regs_per_interval parameter.
- More PoW registrations → higher difficulty → harder puzzles.
- Fewer registrations → lower difficulty → easier puzzles.
- Check current difficulty: `agcli subnet hyperparams <netuid>` → difficulty

Practical tips:
- Use `--threads` to set the number of CPU threads for parallel searching.
- PoW is competitive — someone else may solve it before you.
- Solutions expire quickly — compute and submit within the same block window.
- Some subnets have very high difficulty (hundreds of thousands), making PoW
  impractical. Check difficulty before spending CPU time.
- Energy cost: compare the electricity cost of PoW vs the burn registration fee.
  Often burn is cheaper for established subnets.

When to use PoW:
- You have spare CPU/GPU capacity and want to avoid spending TAO.
- The burn cost is high relative to your TAO holdings.
- You're running a bootstrapping operation on a new (low-difficulty) subnet.

Key hyperparams:
- difficulty: current PoW target difficulty
- min_difficulty / max_difficulty: difficulty bounds
- adjustment_interval: blocks between difficulty adjustments
- target_regs_per_interval: target registrations that drive adjustment";

const ARCHIVE: &str = "\
ARCHIVE NODES & HISTORICAL DATA
================================
Standard Bittensor nodes prune old block state to save disk space. Archive nodes
retain the full state for every block, enabling historical queries.

Why archive nodes matter:
- Standard (pruned) nodes only keep recent state (~256 blocks).
- Querying old blocks on a pruned node returns 'State already discarded' errors.
- Archive nodes store every block's state, so you can query any historical block.

Using archive nodes in agcli:
  # Use the built-in archive network preset
  agcli balance --at-block 3000000 --network archive

  # Or specify a custom archive endpoint
  agcli subnet metagraph --netuid 1 --at-block 3000000 --endpoint wss://your-archive:443

  # Set as default in config
  agcli config set --key network --value archive

Commands that support --at-block (historical wayback):
  agcli balance --at-block N
  agcli stake list --at-block N
  agcli subnet list --at-block N
  agcli subnet show --netuid X --at-block N
  agcli subnet metagraph --netuid X --at-block N
  agcli view network --at-block N
  agcli view portfolio --at-block N
  agcli view dynamic --at-block N
  agcli view neuron --netuid X --uid Y --at-block N
  agcli view validators --at-block N
  agcli view account --at-block N

Block explorer:
  agcli block latest        # Current block info
  agcli block info --number N   # Details for a specific block

Known archive providers:
- OnFinality:  wss://bittensor-finney.api.onfinality.io/public-ws (built-in)
- Self-hosted: Run a subtensor node with --pruning=archive

Tips:
- Archive queries are slower than standard queries due to state retrieval.
- The --network archive flag automatically uses a public archive endpoint.
- For heavy historical analysis, consider running your own archive node.
- Auto-detection: if --at-block hits pruned state, agcli suggests using --network archive.";
